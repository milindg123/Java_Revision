/*
 	Four Pillars of OOP
 	
 	1) Encapsulation :  Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data and method under a single unit.
 						It also implements data hiding.
 						
 						
 						Data Hiding : useless or sensitive data we can make them as (private) i.e private data members
 									--> We can use access specifier for the data hiding.
